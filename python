""" John is tasked with configuring the lighting for a high-profile event, where different lighting modes affect the ambiance of the venue. He can choose from three distinct lighting modes, each requiring a specific adjustment to the initial light intensity:



Ambient Lighting (Mode 1): The intensity level is multiplied by 1.5.
Stage Lighting (Mode 2): The intensity level is multiplied by 2.0.
Spotlight (Mode 3): The intensity level is multiplied by 1.8.


In the event that an invalid mode is provided, the program should output an error message indicating the invalid selection. 



Your task is to write a program that reads the selected lighting mode and the initial intensity level, applies the appropriate adjustment, and prints the final intensity.

Input format :
The first line of input is an integer n, representing the lighting mode.

The second line is a floating value m, representing the initial intensity level of the light.

Output format :
The output displays "Intensity: " followed by a float representing the adjusted intensity level, formatted to two decimal places, if the mode is valid.

If the mode is invalid, the output should display "Invalid"."""


# Read the lighting mode
lightingMode = int(input())

# Initialize the intensity level variable
intensityLevel = 0.0

# Using a while loop to mimic switch-case behavior
mode_found = False
while not mode_found:
    if lightingMode == 1:  # Disco lights
        intensityLevel = float(input())
        intensityLevel *= 1.5  # Multiply by 1.5
        mode_found = True
    elif lightingMode == 2:  # Strobe lights
        intensityLevel = float(input())
        intensityLevel *= 2  # Multiply by 2
        mode_found = True
    elif lightingMode == 3:  # Laser lights
        intensityLevel = float(input())
        intensityLevel *= 1.8  # Multiply by 1.8
        mode_found = True
    else:
        print("Invalid")
        break

if mode_found:
    # Print the intensity level with 2 decimal places
    print(f"Intensity: {intensityLevel:.2f}")
